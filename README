c. How to run
python main.py <account key> <t_es> <t_ec> <host>
<account key>: 	bing api key 		
<t_es>:   		float in (0, 1), 	
<t_ec>:       	int
<host>: 		database url

d. Internal design
part 1)
This part implements the algorithm in Fig 4 of the paper.
1.Firstly query lists corresponding to certain categories are parsed from txt files.
2.Then use bing api to search the each query in the list and save 'Webtotal' numbers(which is useful for calculating specificity and coverage) and top four web results' urls.
3.Finally check if a certain category can meet the Especificity and Ecoverage requirements, return all satisfied categories.


part 2)
After getting all the url for each category, 
	1. For each level-1 category, duplicate urls are elimiated. All the url are retrieved except pdf and ppt. If there is error during retrieval, the url is ignored. 
	2. For root category, duplicate urls from subcategories are eliminated and content summary from subcategories are calculated and stored during previous rounds which will also be included in root's content summary.
After url retrieval, each page is processed.
Then map<word, frequency> is built and then wrote to file.
Each page retrieved is processed before fetching next page to space requests.

f. Performance
Classificaiton is the same as reference. However, content summary are slightly differet due to different factors: lynx unable to open url, different methods and uncertainties of fetching top-4 url, including pdf/ppt or not, small difference in parsing documents...
Nevertheless, while the word number might have a big difference due to pdf/ppt, the word frequency difference is quite small compared to the large sample document sizes. And for those important words, we see the exact match in frquency.

For example, health.com with 0.6 and 100, some of the outputs:
