c. How to run
python main.py <account key> <t_es> <t_ec> <host>
<account key>: 	bing api key 		
<t_es>:   		float in (0, 1), 	
<t_ec>:       	int
<host>: 		database url

d. Internal design
part 1)
This part implements the algorithm in Fig 4 of the paper.
1.Firstly query lists corresponding to certain categories are parsed from txt files.
2.Then use bing api to search the each query in the list and save 'Webtotal' numbers(which is useful for calculating specificity and coverage) and top four web results' urls.
3.Finally check if a certain category can meet the Especificity and Ecoverage requirements, return all satisfied categories.


part 2)
After getting all the url for each category, 
	For each level-1 category, duplicate urls are elimiated. All the url are retrieved except pdf and ppt. If there is an error during url retrieval, the url is ignored; 
	For root category, duplicate urls from subcategories are eliminated.
After url retrieval, for each page,
	Remove reference section at the end.
	Remove everything inside [].
	Change char other than alphabet to space.
	Separate words by space.
	Change words to lowercase.
Then map<word, frequency> is built and then wrote to file.
Each page retrieved is processed before fetching next page to space requests.
